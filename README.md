# 📦 E-Commerce Sales Analysis

This project is a hands-on exercise in exploring, cleaning, querying, and visualizing a large e-commerce dataset of over **800,000 rows**. It was designed to improve and showcase my skills in **real-world e-commerce data analysis**, while practicing **SQL** and **Power BI** together. The project focuses on analyzing online sales trends, customer behavior, return rates, and the impact of discounts on performance.

## 🕒 Project Timeline

I started this project after completing my [ER-Hospital Visits Analysis](https://github.com/Qusaix17/ER-hospital-visits-analysis.git).  
My goal was to push my data skills further by working with a large, multi-year transactional dataset that mimics real e-commerce business data.

The methodology follows the data analysis process taught in the Google Data Analytics course:  
**Ask → Prepare → Process → Analyze → Share → Act**

## 📊 Key Insights

Despite the dataset being synthetic and anonymized, the project revealed several meaningful trends:

- 🇬🇧 **United Kingdom** had the highest volume of orders and revenue, followed by the Netherlands and Germany.
- 📅 **December** recorded the highest sales overall, likely due to holiday season shopping activity.
- 💸 **Discounts** had mixed effects—boosting quantity sold in some categories, but not always increasing overall revenue.
- 🔁 **Return rates** were higher in low-priority orders and online purchases.
- 🏆 **Top-performing products** were identified based on total revenue and frequency of orders.
- 📊 **KPI comparisons** between sales with and without discounts helped visualize trends and potential profit losses.
